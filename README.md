# GraphQL Client

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/crossroads-loyalty-solutions/graphql-client.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A simple graphql-client library where queries are just typed strings and
responses are just promises.

## Features

* Simple: Queries are just strings with phantom types for variables and
  response-type.
* Easy batching: Can automatically batch all calls and ensure they are
  performed serially.
* Simple cache: Caches responses based on query and variables.

## Installation

```
npm i @crossroads-loyalty-solutions/graphql-client
```
